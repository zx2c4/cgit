CGITRC(5)
========


NAME
----
cgitrc - runtime configuration for cgit


SYNOPSIS
--------
Cgitrc contains all runtime settings for cgit, including the list of git
repositories, formatted as a line-separated list of NAME=VALUE pairs. Blank
lines, and lines starting with '#', are ignored.


LOCATION
--------
The default location of cgitrc, defined at compile time, is /etc/cgitrc. At
runtime, cgit will consult the environment variable CGIT_CONFIG and, if
defined, use its value instead.


GLOBAL SETTINGS
---------------
about-filter::
	Specifies a command which will be invoked to format the content of
	about pages (both top-level and for each repository). The command will
	get the content of the about-file on its STDIN, and the STDOUT from the
	command will be included verbatim on the about page. Default value:
	none. See also: "FILTER API".

agefile::
	Specifies a path, relative to each repository path, which can be used
	to specify the date and time of the youngest commit in the repository.
	The first line in the file is used as input to the "parse_date"
	function in libgit. Recommended timestamp-format is "yyyy-mm-dd
	hh:mm:ss". Default value: "info/web/last-modified".

cache-root::
	Path used to store the cgit cache entries. Default value:
	"/var/cache/cgit". See also: "MACRO EXPANSION".

	Number which specifies the time-to-live, in minutes, for the cached
	version of the repository summary page. Default value: "5".

cache-root-ttl::
	Number which specifies the time-to-live, in minutes, for the cached
	version of the repository index page. Default value: "5".

cache-scanrc-ttl::

	repository url, generates valid clone urls for the repository. This
	setting is only used if `repo.clone-url` is unspecified. Default value:
	none.

clone-url::
	Space-separated list of clone-url templates. This setting is only
	used if `repo.clone-url` is unspecified. Default value: none. See
	also: "MACRO EXPANSION", "FILTER API".

commit-filter::
	Specifies a command which will be invoked to format commit messages.
	The command will get the message on its STDIN, and the STDOUT from the
	command will be included verbatim as the commit message, i.e. this can
	be used to implement bugtracker integration. Default value: none.
	See also: "FILTER API".

css::
	Url which specifies the css document to include in all cgit pages.
	Default value: "/cgit.css".

	value: none.

root-title::
	Text printed as heading on the repository index page. Default value:
	"Git Repository Browser".

scan-hidden-path::
	If set to "1" and scan-path is enabled, scan-path will recurse into
	directories whose name starts with a period ('.'). Otherwise,
	scan-path will stay away from such directories (considered as
	"hidden"). Note that this does not apply to the ".git" directory in
	non-bare repos. This must be defined prior to scan-path.
	Default value: 0. See also: scan-path.

scan-path::
	A path which will be scanned for repositories. If caching is enabled,
	the result will be cached as a cgitrc include-file in the cache
	directory. If project-list has been defined prior to scan-path,
	scan-path loads only the directories listed in the file pointed to by
	project-list. Be advised that only the global settings taken
	before the scan-path directive will be applied to each repository.
	Default value: none. See also: cache-scanrc-ttl, project-list,
	"MACRO EXPANSION".

section::
	The name of the current repository section - all repositories defined
	after this option will inherit the current section name. Default value:
	none.

section-from-path::
	A number which, if specified before scan-path, specifies how many
	path elements from each repo path to use as a default section name.
	If negative, cgit will discard the specified number of path elements
	above the repo directory. Default value: 0.

side-by-side-diffs::
	If set to "1" shows side-by-side diffs instead of unidiffs per
	default. Default value: "0".

snapshots::
	Text which specifies the default set of snapshot formats generated by
	cgit. The value is a space-separated list of zero or more of the
	values "tar", "tar.gz", "tar.bz2", "tar.xz" and "zip". Default value:
	none.

source-filter::
	Specifies a command which will be invoked to format plaintext blobs
	in the tree view. The command will get the blob content on its STDIN
	and the name of the blob as its only command line argument. The STDOUT
	from the command will be included verbatim as the blob contents, i.e.
	this can be used to implement e.g. syntax highlighting. Default value:
	none. See also: "FILTER API".

summary-branches::
	Specifies the number of branches to display in the repository "summary"
	view. Default value: "10".

summary-log::
	Specifies the number of log entries to display in the repository
	"summary" view. Default value: "10".

summary-tags::
	Specifies the number of tags to display in the repository "summary"
	view. Default value: "10".

strict-export::
	Filename which, if specified, needs to be present within the repository
	for cgit to allow access to that repository. This can be used to emulate
	gitweb's EXPORT_OK and STRICT_EXPORT functionality and limit cgit's
	repositories to match those exported by git-daemon. This option MUST come
	before 'scan-path'.

virtual-root::
	Url which, if specified, will be used as root for all cgit links. It
	will also cause cgit to generate 'virtual urls', i.e. urls like
	'/cgit/tree/README' as opposed to '?r=cgit&p=tree&path=README'. Default
	value: none.
	NOTE: cgit has recently learned how to use PATH_INFO to achieve the
	same kind of virtual urls, so this option will probably be deprecated.

REPOSITORY-SPECIFIC CGITRC FILE
-------------------------------
When the option "scan-path" is used to auto-discover git repositories, cgit
will try to parse the file "cgitrc" within any found repository. Such a
repo-specific config file may contain any of the repo-specific options
described above, except "repo.url" and "repo.path". Additionally, the "filter"
options are only acknowledged in repo-specific config files when
"enable-filter-overrides" is set to "1".

Note: the "repo." prefix is dropped from the option names in repo-specific
config files, e.g. "repo.desc" becomes "desc".


FILTER API
----------
about filter::
	This filter is given no arguments. The about text that is to be
	filtered is available on standard input and the filtered text is
	expected on standard output.

commit filter::
	This filter is given no arguments. The commit message text that is to
	be filtered is available on standard input and the filtered text is
	expected on standard output.

source filter::
	This filter is given a single parameter: the filename of the source
	file to filter. The filter can use the filename to determine (for
	example) the syntax highlighting mode. The contents of the source
	file that is to be filtered is available on standard input and the
	filtered contents is expected on standard output.

Also, all filters are handed the following environment variables:

- CGIT_REPO_URL (from repo.url)
- CGIT_REPO_NAME (from repo.name)
- CGIT_REPO_PATH (from repo.path)
- CGIT_REPO_OWNER (from repo.owner)
- CGIT_REPO_DEFBRANCH (from repo.defbranch)
- CGIT_REPO_SECTION (from repo.section)
- CGIT_REPO_CLONE_URL (from repo.clone-url)

If a setting is not defined for a repository and the corresponding global
setting is also not defined (if applicable), then the corresponding
environment variable will be unset.


MACRO EXPANSION
---------------
The following cgitrc options supports a simple macro expansion feature,
where tokens prefixed with "$" are replaced with the value of a similary
named environment variable:

- cache-root
- include
- project-list
- scan-path

Macro expansion will also happen on the content of $CGIT_CONFIG, if
defined.

One usage of this feature is virtual hosting, which in its simplest form
can be accomplished by adding the following line to /etc/cgitrc:

	include=/etc/cgitrc.d/$HTTP_HOST

The following options are expanded during request processing, and support
the environment variables defined in "FILTER API":

- clone-url
- repo.clone-url

BUGS
----
Comments currently cannot appear on the same line as a setting; the comment
will be included as part of the value. E.g. this line:

	robots=index  # allow indexing

will generate the following html element:

	<meta name='robots' content='index  # allow indexing'/>
